# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNITION-USING-TENSORFLOW-AND-PYTHON

Recognized digits of different sizes and orientations from various sources such as e-mails, bank cheques etc.

Made use of MNIST dataset and Neural Networks. The algorithm used to carry out the project is Sequential Neural Network which is known to be one of the easiest methods to build a model in Keras.
